**PyOpenGL and PyBullet Sandbox**

A non-voxel construction sandbox using PyOpenGL and PyBullet. It is still in development.

**Running the Program:**

- Find Out how to run Python files on your OS.
- Run main.py

(On Linux, this is as simple as `cd`-ing to the right directory and typing `python main.py`)
(On Windows, you can use `C:\path\to\python\library\python.exe main.py`, or so the internet told me. You may have to install python, I haven't actually tried this myself yet.)

REQUIREMENTS:

- Python 2
- PyOpenGL (`pip install PyOpenGL`)
- PyBullet (`pip install pybullet`)
- PyGame (`pip install pygame`)
- The time, math and random libraries which come with Python by default.
